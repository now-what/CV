## Francesco Colombo

I am studying to become a software engineer, and I have a background in journalism, communications, online marketing, SEO and most recently banking and financial crime. 
At Monzo Bank, I work as a Quality Assessor for the bank's fincrime controls (both retail and business banking).
The bank's "only branches are on GitHub", so here I am trying to make sense of them all.
